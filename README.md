I undertook a challenging and rewarding Final Year Project titled 'Online Jewelry Shop,' 
which showcases my proficiency in web development using the MERN (MongoDB, 
Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. Leveraging my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
I designed an engaging and user-friendly e-commerce platform for buying and 
selling Jewelry online. The project demonstrated my ability to create a dynamic and 
responsive front-end with React.js, ensuring an intuitive user interface. On the back- 
end, I implemented a robust server using Node.js and Express.js, providing a secure 
and efficient connection between the client and the database. MongoDB served as the 
database, allowing seamless data storage and retrieval. This project not only 
deepened my understanding of full-stack development but also honed my problem- 
solving skills in handling real-world challenges in web application development.
